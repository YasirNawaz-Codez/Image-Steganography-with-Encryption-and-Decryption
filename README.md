# Image-Steganography-with-Encryption-and-Decryption
This project is about Image Steganography with Encryption and Decryption using OpenCV and Python. The objective of the project is to combine steganography and cryptography to achieve secure data hiding, demonstrate the encryption and decryption processes, and utilize the OpenCV library in Python for image processing and manipulation. Cryptography is the practice of securing communication and protecting information, while steganography focuses on concealing information within other data. The project employs the power of OpenCV and Python, where OpenCV provides various functions and algorithms for image processing and manipulation, and Python serves as a versatile programming language for implementing steganography and encryption techniques. The encryption process involves reading the original image, extracting the dimensions of the image, obtaining the user's encryption key and the text to be hidden, hiding the text within the image using bitwise XOR operations, and finally saving the encrypted image. The decryption process involves reading the encrypted image, retrieving the user's decryption key, extracting the hidden text using bitwise XOR operations, and displaying the decrypted text. The security key plays a vital role in ensuring that only authorized recipients can decrypt the hidden message. The project concludes that image steganography combined with encryption and decryption techniques can provide a secure method of hiding sensitive information within digital images, opening up possibilities for secure communication in various domains.
